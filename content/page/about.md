I am an accomplished professional in web development with **3 years of experience** and a passion to create IT products and solutions which would help people in the most humane, sincere and reliable ways as possible. I adore working in healthcare, education and business fields. I’m capable to design, implement and maintain wide variety of systems. Strong in web development using both, **server side** and **client side** technologies.

Currently I'm working as a **Full Stack Web Developer** and I'm very interested in **.NET Core, NodeJs, React, Redux, Typescript, ES2016, Bootstrap 4.0** technologies. Currently I'm trying to transition from **React** to **React Fiber**, from **REST** to **GraphQL** technologies. Learn something new about **WebAssembly**. Now, that my university studies are finished, I'm concentrated on my **IT certifications** much more.

I'm always looking forward to interesting projects, new opportunities to grow and level up my career. I‘m eager and not afraid to learn and try new technologies, methodologies and patterns. Gaining fresh and new experience is my ongoing lifetime goal. I've been a student since I was a little boy - gaining and sharing knowledge is what I do best. I‘m really fascinated with how new technologies are developing and I am proud of myself being a part of it.

I'm always happy to help if i can. Let's connect !
